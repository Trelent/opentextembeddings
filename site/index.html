        <h1>Open-source Text Embeddings</h1>
        <h4>
          We made an OpenAI-like API so that you can instantly use better,
          open-source text embedding models. Like the models it is built upon,
          the API is fully open-source

            target="_blank"
            >on GitHub</a
          >
          under an MIT license. We also host a free (within reason) version of
          the API for you to use today.

        <h2>About <a href="https://trelent.com" target="_blank">Trelent</a></h2>
        <p>
          When we're not open-sourcing our infrastructure, Trelent uses LLMs to
          create complex process automation workflows. You can think of it
          somewhat similar to an agent, though we really don't like the term. We
          are venture-backed by multiple funds, have thousands of users, and are
          building fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're hiring a founding engineer to help with our NextJS and Rust
          stack - come build with us! Please apply at
          <a href="https://jobs.trelent.com" target="_blank">jobs.trelent.com</a

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
          Integration is as easy as changing the OpenAI base URL. Here are some
          examples:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Python SDK
openai.api_base = "https://api.opentextembeddings.com/v1"
openai.Embedding.create(
  model="bge-large-en",
  input="Hey, is this API working?"
)
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Langchain
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(
  openai_api_base="https://api.opentextembeddings.com/v1",
  model="bge-large-en"
)
embeddings = embeddings_model.embed_documents([
  "I think it is!",
  "Sweet, I love better embeddings!"
])
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// JavaScript SDK
const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiBase: 'https://api.opentextembeddings.com/v1',
});

const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
  model: "bge-base-en",
  input: "Yeah, it's so easy to use!",
});
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">
# cURL + REST API
curl https://api.opentextembeddings.com/v1/embeddings \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "input": "I know. Gonna go share this with everyone right now!",
        "model": "gte-large"

        <h3>Legend</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Model</strong> is the name of the model to use in the API. If
          it has a red background, we do not support it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>MTEB Score</strong> is the average score of the model within
          Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, which consists of over 56 datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dimensions</strong> is the number of dimensions of the
          embedding vectors. A smaller number of dimensions means the embeddings
          are cheaper to store in a vector DB.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Seq Length</strong> is the maximum number of tokens in a
          sequence. Typically anything above 256 is enough for most use cases,
          as most embedding models perform poorly with large chunks of text.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Cost</strong> is the cost per 10M tokens.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          To keep this API free and available to as many people as possible, you
          may only make 100 requests each hour. A single request with multiple
          inputs specified is counted against this limit as the number of inputs
          provided. For example, a request with 10 inputs counts as 10 requests
          against this rate-limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need more than 100 requests per hour, please feel free to
          self-host on your own infrastructure or contact us - we may be able to
          provide a custom limit for good causes. For bulk requests, please
          contact us so we can negotiate some reasonable pricing on a dedicated
          cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to keep this API free for as long as possible, but we
          reserve the right to change this at any time. If you would like to
          support this project, please consider reaching out to us to add nodes
          to our cluster.
