        <h4>
          We made a free OpenAI-like API so you can instantly use better,
          open-source text embedding models. Like the models it is built upon,
          the API is fully open-source
          <a href="https://github.com/trelent/opentextembeddings">on GitHub</a>
          under an MIT license.

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
          Integration is as= easy as changing the OpenAI base URL. Here are some
          examples:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Python SDK
openai.api_base = "https://api.opentextembeddings.com/v1"
openai.Embedding.create(
  model="bge-large-en",
  input="Hey, is this API working?"
)
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// JavaScript SDK
const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiBase: 'https://api.opentextembeddings.com/v1',
});

const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
  model: "bge-base-en",
  input: "I think it is!",
});
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">
# cURL + REST API
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "input": "Sweet, I love better embeddings!",
        "model": "gte-large"
    }'
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Legend</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Model</strong> is the name of the model to use in the API. If
          it has a red background, we do not support it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>MTEB Score</strong> is the average score of the model within
          Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, which consists of over 56 datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dimensions</strong> is the number of dimensions of the
          embedding vectors. A smaller number of dimensions means the embeddings
          are cheaper to store in a vector DB.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Seq Length</strong> is the maximum number of tokens in a
          sequence. Typically anything above 256 is enough for most use cases,
          as most embedding models perform poorly with large chunks of text.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Cost</strong> is the cost per 10M tokens.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          To keep this API free and available to as many people as possible, you
          may only make 100 requests each hour. A single request with multiple
          inputs specified is counted against this limit as the number of inputs
          provided. For example, a request with 10 inputs counts as 10 requests
          against this rate-limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need more than 100 requests per hour, please feel free to
          self-host on your own infrastructure or contact us - we may be able to
          provide a custom limit for good causes. For bulk requests, please
          contact us so we can negotiate some reasonable pricing on a dedicated
          cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to keep this API free for as long as possible, but we
          reserve the right to change this at any time. If you would like to
          support this project, please consider reaching out to us to add nodes
          to our cluster.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          This API was built and provided by the team at
          <a href="https://trelent.com">Trelent</a>. In our day jobs, we use
          LLMs to create process automation workflows. We built this API because
          we needed a robust way to embed text (and in the future, more
          modalities) and we wanted to share it with the world.
